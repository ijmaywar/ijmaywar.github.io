## About Me
I’m a Research Associate at CUNY’s Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC). I have a background in data science and quantitative research, particularly with geospatial/time-series data, and am interested in data-driven decision making. 

My primary coding languages are Python, SQL, and R. I have a Master's in Marine, Atmospheric, and Sustainability Sciences from Stony Brook University and Bachelors' in Mathematics and Biology from Skidmore College. 

Please feel free to reach out! I'm always happy to chat about my work and to expand and learn from my network :)
