# NASA GLOBE
NASA GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment), launched by Al Gore in the 1990s, is a global earth-monitoring citizen science and education program. 
Over the course of three decades, participants have contributed hundreds of millions of observations through manual in-situ measurements and automated sensors. 
Variables recorded by this program include air and surface temperature (the focus of the figures shown here study), mosquito habitats, soil moisture, and water transparency. 

Characteristic of citizen science, GLOBE’s data stream is irregular and noisy, creating challenges to analysis. 
Investigating these data provides insight into how citizen science can advance environmental understanding and play a role in monitoring a changing world.
